                Bitchin' Don't take it so personally, okay? I don't like most people. He's in the vast majority. Let's
                burn that lab to the ground.
                Hey kiddo, would you like a balloon? It's just, sometimes...
                people don't really say what they're really thinking. But when you capture the right moment, it says
                more.
            </p>
            <p>
                YOU BETTER RUN! She's our friend, and she's crazy! Why are you keeping this curiosity door lock? It's
                just, sometimes...
                people don't really say what they're really thinking. But when you capture the right moment, it says
                more. So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out?

                So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out? If anyone asks where I am, I've left the country. It's just,

                Why's he gotta kick the door? You're going to take out the demigorgon with a slingshot? You're right.
                You are a freak….
                Who would you rather be friends with: Bowie or Kenny Rogers? You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're
                beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.
                She shut one door! With her mind!

            <p>
                Mistakes have been made. No... no El, you're not the monster. You saved me.
                Do you understand? You saved me. Why's he gotta kick the door? You shouldn't like things because people
                tell you you're supposed to.
                Why do we even need weapons anyway? We have her.
